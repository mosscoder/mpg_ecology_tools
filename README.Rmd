## Introduction

Welcome to the [Ecology Tools app*](mpgranch.shinyapps.io/ecology_tools), a resource developed to support research and management at MPG Ranch. One critical objective in ecology is understanding how biological patterns correlate with environmental conditions, such as aspects of terrain (abiotic), vegetation structure (biotic), and land-use history (anthropogenic). Ecology Tools visualizes environmental variability and facilitate its study across the property. Some use cases for the app include selection of survey sites, identifying areas environmentally similar to a point of interest, guiding native seed collection, and identifying homogeneous units for targeted restoration seeding. 

*<i>Please note that this tool is not yet optimized for smart phone or tablet devices.</i>

## Background

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="300px", out.extra='style="float:right; padding:10px"'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/overview.png?raw=true")
```
At the heart of the app is a product that depicts environmental sub-divisions, or clusters, across MPG Ranch. Within each cluster you will find conditions are homogeneous in terms of elevation, slope, solar inputs, drainage, plant canopy cover, plant canopy height, and probability of past agricultural activity. These clusters do not represent an attempt to classify the study region into discrete habitat types, though there may be some correspondence. The clusters are best thought of as a device to evenly sample the range of environmental conditions present on the property. Observing the full range of conditions is critical to training contemporary models that learn by example. For further information on the methods for developing the clusters please refer to <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vTcnPVBAkI0Pbwa0gc0LmNPKL_91BtwnLOWDMSwurHrc_D9l45IKcbwOtw3Uhu_iA4zTXU6F5Xs1Zph/pub">this document</a>.

## Basics
### Toggle overlays on/off
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/transparency.png?raw=true")
```

Once the app is loaded you will see an interactive map. By default the grid point network and environmental clusters are displayed. Transparency of the cluster overlay may be adjusted with the transparency slider in the upper right and both points and overlay may be toggled on and off in the layers controls, also found in the upper right.

### Visualize cluster extent
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/highlights.png?raw=true")
```

To visualize the spatial extent of a cluster you may hover over a region of the map with your cursor and the underlying cluster will be highlighted in red. Note that clusters and points are colored such that similar colors correspond to similar environmental conditions. Also note that you can reveal the ID of any grid point by hovering your cursor over it. 

### Inspect cluster conditions
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/clust_report.png?raw=true")
```

To inspect the conditions within a cluster you may click on it. This produces a report with a static map of the cluster extent and violin plots that show the range and probability density of the seven environmental properties upon which the cluster analysis was based. Also included in this report are suggested native forb seed mixes for average and drought years depending on whether the objective is to enhance cover or diversity (under development).

### Filter points by sampling year
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/survey_years.png?raw=true")
```

By default all grid points are shown, but points may be filtered by suggested annual sampling locations using the drop down menu in the upper left corner. In this strategy a single point is observed from each of the 63 environmental clusters each year. This strategy was developed for the vegetation survey, but may be applied to any monitoring effort. To download a spreadsheet and Google Earth layer containing the metadata of the selected points, click the download button to the right of the point selection drop down menu. 

### Zoom to grid point
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/zoomto.png?raw=true")
```

To focus the map on a grid point of interest, type the ID number into the "Zoom to point..." text box in the upper left. 

## Advanced features
### Similarity mode
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/sim_mode.png?raw=true")
```

By toggling similarity mode on (switch in upper left) you can identify sites and grid points that are environmentally similar to a point of interest. Simply click on the map when similarity mode is active.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/sim_output.png?raw=true")
```

After clicking a point of interest a popup will appear containing another interactive map and table.

### Similarity map
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/sim_map.png?raw=true")
```

Within the map you will find grid points colored by their similarity to the clicked point (overlayed as blue pin) of interest as well as a heatmap, also colored by similarity. Dark red values indicate high environmental similarity and dark blue values indicate low similarity. Both layers may be toggled off with the controls in the upper right 

### Simiarlity table
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="400px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/sim_table.png?raw=true")
```

Within the popup you will also find a table that provides a ranked list of grid points sorted by environmental similarity to the clicked point. The environmental cluster of the grid point, its coordinates, and environmental properties are presented in the table. 

### Download data
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.height="100px"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://github.com/mosscoder/mpg_ecology_tools/blob/dev/images/sim_download.png?raw=true")
```

The products of the similarity analyses: heatmap, grid points, and table may be downloaded for offline inspection by clicking the button at the bottom of the popup. The grid points (.kml) will be labeled by their similarity within Google Earth.
